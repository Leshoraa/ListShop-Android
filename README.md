# ListShop Android

**ListShop** is a sleek and modern offline Android application designed to help users manage their shopping routines more efficiently. The app integrates smart AI capabilities to assist with product identification and description generation, all while maintaining a clean and minimalist user interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Product Description**  
  Snap a photo of a product using your phone's camera, and **Gemini AI** will automatically generate a relevant **title and description** for the product.

- 🛒 **Smart Market List with RecyclerView**  
  Organize your shopping experience by creating a list of **markets/stores**, each containing:
  - 📦 A dynamic product list with individual **quantity counters**.
  - 📝 A built-in **shopping checklist** that helps you keep track of what you need to buy — check off items as you go!

- 🧾 **Market-to-Cart Flow**  
  Upon launching the app, you're prompted to create a list of **markets or stores** you plan to visit.  
  Each market acts as a separate entry point.  
  When selected, it opens a dedicated **shopping cart screen** where you can manage the items to be purchased from that specific market.

  Effortlessly manage your data with:
  - ➕ Add new markets, products, and to-buy items.
